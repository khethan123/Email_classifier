# Email_classifier
**A type of spam classifier based on:**
  1.  the subject of the email
  2.  the contents of the email

The `subject` part basically has a dataframe of 2 columns (category and subject) and it is not upto the standard since it's recall was too low.
The `contents` part on the other hand proved to be quite useful.
